# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project aims to create a simple Etch A Sketch like game. The user can hover over tiles on the game grid to color them randomly. The game allows the user to resize the grid and darken tiles by hovering their mouse over it again. This project was created using basic javascript and css skills, prominently flexbox and basic events.
